# Heuristic Optimization Methods: Public Transport Parking Problem

Description of the problem:
These instructions describe the problem of parking vehicles in public transport companies storage areas. Vehicles are parked in the parking lanes, bearing in mind the departure time of the vehicles in the storage area, so that any vehicle can exit the storage area with ease and on time in the morning. As well as deciding in which lane to place the vehicle, looking out for the length of the vehicle and the length of each lane, there are additional restrictions that make the problem much more complex:  
• Specific vehicles need to be placed into the lanes with specific equipment: tram can only be parked on the rail track, a trolleybus exclusively on the track with an electrical contact line etc.  
• A vehicle can't leave the lane if there is a vehicle in front of it. That is, the time of the departure of the first vehicle in the lane has to precede the departure time of the second vehicle. Also, in specific cases vehicles in one lane can block the vehicles from another lane. There are cases in which all of the vehicles from one lane have to leave the storage area before any of the vehicles from the other track  
• The time of the departure has to be strictly abided by for all of the vehicles  
• Specific vehicles can have a specific schedule.  For a group of vehicles, there may be an enhanced timing arrangement or a special maintenance schedule
